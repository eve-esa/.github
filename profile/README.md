**Earth Virtual Expert (EVE)**  
An open science initiative funded by the **European Space Agency’s Φ-lab**, developed by **Pi School** in collaboration with **Imperative Space** and **Mistral AI**, aimed at advancing the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for the Earth Observation (EO) and Earth Science (ES) community.

## Overview  

EVE is a domain-specialized AI system designed to support **scientists, analysts, and decision-makers** through natural-language interaction.

It provides expert assistance across tasks such as:  
- EO and ES knowledge search and summarisation  
- Scientific Q&A and policy brief generation  
- Document understanding and retrieval  
- Technical and educational content creation  
- Integration of private EO document collections via RAG  

The project unites **data curation, model development, evaluation, and deployment** to deliver open, reusable tools for Europe’s EO ecosystem.

## Chat Platform  

EVE features an interactive **chat platform** that allows users to explore and query Earth Observation and Earth Science knowledge through natural dialogue.  
The platform is currently under **closed access** — you can request early registration [**here**](https://eve.philab.esa.int/pilot).  
It is targeted for **public release in early 2026**.

## Model Development  

`EVE-instruct` is trained on domain-curated corpora by fine-tuning **Mistral Small 3.2 24B**, through **continued pretraining** and **instruction fine-tuning**.  
- The model is optimized for factuality, reasoning, and integration with retrieval-augmented generation.  
- Training was carried out using **EuroHPC Marenostrum**, cloud environments, and **Mistral infrastructure**.  
- Evaluation targets both **general domain** and **EO-specific** benchmarks.

## Licence  

All EVE releases follow **ESA and EU open-science principles**, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and European AI sovereignty.  
The project’s outputs—**models, datasets, pipelines, and documentation**—are shared under **permissive open-source licences** (Apache 2.0 / CC-BY).
